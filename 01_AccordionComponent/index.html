            <dt class="activeLink">Which planet is the Earth from the Sun?</dt>
            <dd class="active">
                The Earth is the third planet from the Sun. This is because the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun, and when counting from the closest planet to the farthest, Earth falls in third place. The order of planets from the Sun is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

            <dt>What temperature does water boil at sea level?</dt>
            <dd>
                Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level. This is because boiling point is defined as the temperature at which a liquid changes into its gaseous state. At sea level, where atmospheric pressure is relatively constant, water molecules have enough energy to overcome intermolecular forces and transition into vapor form.

            <dt>What is the speed of light?</dt>
            <dd>
                The speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This value represents how fast light travels in a vacuum. It has been determined through extensive scientific experiments and observations. Light travels so quickly that it can cover a distance of about 7 times around Earth's equator in just one second!

            <dt>How does gravity work between objects?</dt>
            <dd>
                Gravity works between objects by pulling them towards each other with a force that depends on their masses and the distance between them. The force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass of each object, meaning that objects with greater mass exert a stronger gravitational pull. Additionally, the force of gravity decreases as the distance between objects increases, following an inverse square relationship.

            <dt>Can energy be created or destroyed?</dt>
            <dd>
                No, energy cannot be created or destroyed according to the principle of conservation of energy. Energy can only change its form or be transferred from one object to another. This principle is based on the laws of thermodynamics and has been extensively observed and tested in various scientific experiments. It means that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant over time.
